Description: tool for extracting subsets of Boost C++ Libraries
 Part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The bcp utility is a tool for extracting subsets of Boost, it's useful
 for Boost authors who want to distribute their library separately from
 Boost, and for Boost users who want to distribute a subset of Boost
 with their application.
 .
 bcp can also report on which parts of Boost your code is dependent on,
 and what licences are used by those dependencies.

Description: Boost C++ Libraries development files
 The Boost web site provides free, peer-reviewed, portable C++ source
 libraries. The emphasis is on libraries which work well with the C++
 Standard Library. One goal is to establish "existing practice" and
 provide reference implementations so that the Boost libraries are
 suitable for eventual standardization. Some of the libraries have
 already been proposed for inclusion in the C++ Standards Committee's
 upcoming C++ Standard Library Technical Report.
 .
 For the following subprojects separate packages exist:
 date-time, filesystem, graph, python, regex, signals, test, and thread.

 Part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Boost Python Library is used to quickly and easily export a C++
 library to Python such that the Python interface is very similar to
 the C++ interface. It is designed to be minimally intrusive on your
 C++ design. In most cases, you should not have to alter your C++
 classes in any way in order to use them with Boost.Python.  The
 system should simply "reflect" your C++ classes and functions into
 Python. The major features of Boost.Python include support for:
 Subclassing extension types in Python, Overriding virtual functions
 in Python, Member function Overloading, Automatic wrapping of
 numeric operators among others.

Description: regular expression library for C++
 Part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 Regular expressions are a form of pattern-matching that are often
 used in text processing; many users will be familiar with the Unix
 utilities grep, sed and awk, and the programming language perl, each
 of which make extensive use of regular expressions. Traditionally C++
 users have been limited to the POSIX C APIs for manipulating regular
 expressions, and while regex does provide these APIs, they do not
 represent the best way to use the library. For example regex can cope
 with wide character strings, or search and replace operations (in a
 manner analogous to either sed or perl), something that traditional C
 libraries can not do.

Description: regular expression library for C++
 Part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 Regular expressions are a form of pattern-matching that are often
 used in text processing; many users will be familiar with the Unix
 utilities grep, sed and awk, and the programming language perl, each
 of which make extensive use of regular expressions. Traditionally C++
 users have been limited to the POSIX C APIs for manipulating regular
 expressions, and while regex does provide these APIs, they do not
 represent the best way to use the library. For example regex can cope
 with wide character strings, or search and replace operations (in a
 manner analogous to either sed or perl), something that traditional C
 libraries can not do.

Description: serialization library for C++
 This is a partial list of provided functionalities:
 .
  * proper restoration of pointers to shared data
  * serialization of STL containers and other commonly used templates
  * data portability - streams of bytes created on one platform should
    be readable on any other
  * archive interface must be rich enough to permit the creation of an
    archive that presents serialized data as XML in a useful manner
 .
 serialization: the reversible deconstruction of an arbitrary set of
 C++ data structures to a sequence of bytes.
 archive: to refer to a specific rendering of this stream of bytes.

Description: GNU CLISP, a Common Lisp implementation
 ANSI Common Lisp is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.
 GNU CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation by Bruno Haible of Karlsruhe
 University and Michael Stoll of Munich University, both in Germany.
 It mostly supports the Lisp described in the ANSI Common Lisp standard.
 It runs on most Unix workstations (GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD,
 Solaris, Tru64, HP-UX, BeOS, NeXTstep, IRIX, AIX and others) and on
 other systems (Windows NT/2000/XP, Windows 95/98/ME) and needs only
 4 MB of RAM.
 .
 It is Free Software and may be distributed under the terms of GNU GPL,
 while it is possible to distribute commercial proprietary applications
 compiled with GNU CLISP.
 .
 The user interface comes in English, German, French, Spanish, Dutch,
 Russian and Danish, and can be changed at run time.
 GNU CLISP includes an interpreter, a compiler, a debugger, CLOS, MOP,
 a foreign language interface, sockets, i18n, fast bignums and more.
 An X11 interface is available through CLX, Garnet, CLUE/CLIO.
 GNU CLISP runs Maxima, ACL2 and many other Common Lisp packages.

Description: Interactively examine a C program source
 Cscope is an interactive text screen based source browsing tool.
 Although it is primarily designed to search C code (including lex
 and yacc files), it can also be used for C++ code.
 .
 Using cscope, you can easily search for where symbols are used and
 defined.  Cscope is designed to answer questions like:
 .
     Where is this variable used?
     What is the value of this preprocessor symbol?
     Where is this function in the source files?
     What functions call this function?
     What functions are called by this function?
     Where does the message "out of space" come from?
     Where is this source file in the directory structure?
     What files include this header file?

Description: DHCP server for automatic IP address assignment
 DHCP is a protocol like BOOTP (actually dhcpd includes much of
 the functionality of BOOTPD!). It assigns IP addresses to clients
 based on lease times. DHCP is used extensively by Microsoft and more
 recently also by Apple. It is probably essential in any multi-platform
 environment.
 .
 Multiple Ethernet Interfaces are supported by this DHCP package.
 .
 Note: This package _requires_ a 2.2.x or later Linux kernel. 2.0.x
 kernels are _not_ supported.
 .
 This is the DHCP server from version 2 of the Internet Software
 Consortium DHCP package. For more information visit the ISC web site
 at http://www.isc.org.

 GLUT is a window system independent toolkit for writing OpenGL programs,

 GLUT is designed for constructing small to medium sized OpenGL programs,
 however it is not a full-featured toolkit, so large applications requiring
 sophisticated user interfaces are better off using native window system

Description: collection of image processing tools
 GraphicsMagick provides a set of command-line applications to manipulate
 image files. It is a fork of the ImageMagick project and therefore offers
 a similar set of features, but puts a larger emphasis on stability.
 .
 The tools support a large variety of image formats from the widely used
 jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or image
 formats found on some photo CDs. They can convert between formats,
 concatenate several images into one, annotate and distort them, create
 thumbnails or manipulate the colormap. While all features are available
 from the command-line, the package also includes an image viewer that
 allows interactive manipulation.
 .
 Note that unlike ImageMagick, the GraphicsMagick tools are accessed
 through a single executable called 'gm'. Therefore, GraphicsMagick and
 ImageMagick can be used in parallel. Install package
 graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat to obtain a set of several executables
 that is compatible to ImageMagick's interface.

Description: image processing libraries providing ImageMagick interface
 GraphicsMagick provides libraries in several programming languages to read,
 write and manipulate image files across a large number of formats, from the
 widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or
 image formats found on some photo CDs. There are functions for finegrained
 image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various
 image formats.
 .
 The GraphicsMagick libraries are a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offer
 programming interfaces that are mostly compatible. While there might be
 small differences, experience tells that many programs only use a compatible
 subset and build fine with either GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick.
 .
 While GraphicsMagick uses different names for libraries, classes, and
 helper applications in order to coexist with ImageMagick, this package
 intends to minimise porting efforts by exporting the GraphicsMagick
 interface with the usual ImageMagick names. Note that this package only
 tries to provide build-time compatibility. Run-time libraries of
 ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick are incompatible and cannot be interchanged.
 .
 This package includes compatibility wrappers for the C, C++, and Perl
 libraries.

Description: GStreamer helper programs from the "base" set
 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
 which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do
 anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
 about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means
 that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
 installing new plug-ins.
 .
 This package contains helper programs from the "base" set, an essential
 exemplary set of elements.

Description: GStreamer libraries from the "base" set
 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
 which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do
 anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
 about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means
 that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
 installing new plug-ins.
 .
 This package contains libraries from the "base" set, an essential
 exemplary set of elements.

Description: C++ API to the ImageMagick library
 Magick++ supports an object model which is inspired by PerlMagick. Magick++
 executes faster than PerlMagick since it is accessed from a compiled
 language rather than from a scripting language. This makes it more suitable
 for Web CGI programs which must start-up and execute quickly. Images support
 implicit reference counting so that copy constructors and assignment incur
 almost no cost. The cost of actually copying an image (if necessary) is done
 just before modification and this copy is managed automatically by Magick++.
 De-referenced copies are automatically deleted. The image objects support
 value (rather than pointer)  semantics so it is trivial to support multiple
 generations of an image in memory at one time.
 .
 Magick++ provides integrated support for STL. This support allows Magick++
 to be used with the Standard Template Library (STL) so that the powerful
 containers available (e.g. deque, vector, list, and map)  can be used to
 write programs similar to those possible with Perl and PerlMagick.
 STL-compatible template versions of ImageMagick's list-style operations are
 provided so that operations may be performed on multiple images stored in
 STL containers.

Description: Single library to read/write tar, cpio, pax, zip, iso9660, etc.
 The libarchive library provides a flexible interface for reading and
 writing streaming archive files such as tar and cpio.  The library is
 inherently stream-oriented; readers serially iterate through the archive,
 writers serially add things to the archive.  In particular, note that
 there is no built-in support for random access nor for in-place
 modification.
 .
 libarchive can read at least five tar formats, four cpio formats,
 ISO9660 CD/DVD images (including RockRidge extensions), and ZIP
 files.
 .
 libarchive can write two tar formats (ustar and pax), one cpio format
 (odc/POSIX), and two types of shar files (with and without uuencoding).
 .
 The bsdtar Debian package, which is the default tar(1) on FreeBSD,
 is built using libarchive.  The bsdcpio Debian package is also built
 using libarchive.
 .
 There is also a manpage, tar(5), in libarchive1 that provides
 an excellent description of the various tar file formats.

Description: tar(1) from FreeBSD, using libarchive
 The bsdtar program has a number of advantages over previous tar
 implementations:
 .
  * Library. Since the core functionality is in a library, it can be
    used by other tools, such as pkg_add.
 .
  * Automatic format detection. Libarchive automatically detects the
    compression (none/gzip/bzip2) and format (old tar, ustar, gnutar,
    pax, cpio, iso9660, zip) when reading archives. It does this for
    any data source.
 .
  * Pax Interchange Format Support. This is a POSIX/SUSv3 extension to
    the old "ustar" tar format that adds arbitrary extended attributes
    to each entry. Does everything that GNU tar format does, only
    better.
 .
  * Handles file flags, ACLs, arbitrary pathnames, etc. Pax interchange
    format supports key/value attributes using an easily-extensible
    technique. Arbitrary pathnames, group names, user names, file sizes
    are part of the POSIX standard; libarchive extends this with
    support for file flags, ACLs, and arbitrary device numbers.
 .
  * GNU tar support. Libarchive reads most GNU tar archives. If there
    is demand, this can be improved further.

Description: cpio(1) from FreeBSD, using libarchive
 This package provides an interface similar to cpio(1), but using
 libarchive as the backend for the archiving and extraction of data.
 It can read CPIO, tar, pax, zip, jar, ar, and ISO9660 images and provides
 similar features to the bsdtar package.  Features include:
 .
  * Automatic format detection. Libarchive automatically detects the
    compression (none/gzip/bzip2) and format (old tar, ustar, gnutar,
    pax, cpio, iso9660, zip) when reading archives. It does this for

Description: a macro processing language
 GNU `m4' is an implementation of the traditional UNIX macro
 processor.  It is mostly SVR4 compatible, although it has some
 extensions (for example, handling more than 9 positional parameters to
 macros).  `m4' also has builtin functions for including files, running
 shell commands, doing arithmetic, etc.  Autoconf needs GNU `m4' for
 generating `configure' scripts, but not for running them.

Description: Abstraction library to store configuration settings (BSD-licensed)
 Modular Config System is a library and set of tools which abstract the
 storage of configuration settings away from userland applications.
 .
 It is hoped that by using mcs, that the applications which use it will
 generally have a more congruent feeling in regards to settings.
 .
 Highlights :
  * Cleanly implemented BSD-licenced code.
  * Simple, elegant, non-intrusive programming interface.
  * Modular design allows for third-party configuration backends to be
    implemented without any extra effort on the part of the development
    process of your products.
  * Dummy configuration backend which pretends that the configuration is
    blank.
  * Many other features planned, such as configuration profiles.
  * Robust object-oriented design implemented as low-footprint C, mcs only
    adds a ~20KB memory footprint to your application.
  * Full XDG BASEDIR spec compliance.
  * GConf and KDE Kconfig support.
  * It's fast.
 .
 This package contains the runtime library.

Description: client for setting system time from NTP servers
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks
 accurate by synchronizing them over the Internet or a local network,
 or by following an accurate hardware receiver that interprets GPS,
 DCF-77, NIST or similar time signals.
 .
 ntpdate is a simple NTP client that sets a system's clock to match
 the time obtained by communicating with one or more NTP servers.  It
 is not sufficient, however, for maintaining an accurate clock in the
 long run.  ntpdate by itself is useful for occasionally setting the
 time on machines that do not have full-time network access, such as
 laptops.
 .
 If the full NTP daemon from the package "ntp" is installed, then
 ntpdate is not necessary.

Description: OSSP uuid ISO-C and C++ - shared library
 OSSP uuid is an ISO-C and Perl application programming interface (API)
 and corresponding command line interface (CLI) for the generation of
 DCE 1.1 and ISO/IEC 11578:1996 compliant Universally Unique Identifier
 (UUID). It supports DCE 1.1 variant UUIDs of version 1 (time and node
 based), version 3 (name based) and version 4 (random number based).
 .
 UUIDs are 128 bit numbers which are intended to have a high likelihood
 of uniqueness over space and time and are computationally difficult
 to guess. They are globally unique identifiers which can be locally
 generated without contacting a global registration authority. UUIDs
 are intended as unique identifiers for both mass tagging objects
 with an extremely short lifetime and to reliably identifying very
 persistent objects across a network.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.

 .
 OSSP::uuid provides two Perl APIs:
 .
 The OO-style API is a wrapper around the C-style API and intended for
 high-level and regular programming.
 .
 The C-style API is a direct mapping of the OSSP uuid ISO-C API to Perl and
 is intended for low-level programming.
 .
 The Debian package provides also Data::UUID interface so OSSP::uuid can be
 used as free replacement for non-DFSG Perl module.

Description: The GNU Parted disk partition resizing program
 GNU Parted is a program that allows you to create, destroy,
 resize, move and copy hard disk partitions. This is useful
 for creating space for new operating systems, reorganising
 disk usage, and copying data to new hard disks. This package
 contains the Parted binary and manual page.
 .
 Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD, GPT, MIPS and
 PC98 disklabels/partition tables, as well as a 'loop' (raw
 disk) type which allows use on RAID/LVM. Filesystems which
 are currently fully supported are ext2, ext3, fat (FAT16
 and FAT32), ReiserFS (with libreiserfs) and linux-swap.
 Parted can also detect and remove HFS (Mac OS), JFS, NTFS,
 UFS (Sun and HP), XFS and ASFS/AFFS/APFS (Amiga) filesystems,
 but cannot create, resize or check these filesystems yet.
 .
 Note that ReiserFS support is only enabled if you install
 the libreiserfs0.3-0 package. Since libreiserfs0.3-0 has been
 removed from sarge, ReiserFS support is not compiled in the
 default package.
 .
 The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause
 massive data loss. While there are no known bugs at the moment,
 they could exist, so please back up all important files before
 running it, and do so at your own risk.

Description: The GNU Parted disk partitioning library i18n support
 GNU Parted is a program that allows you to create, destroy,
 resize, move and copy hard disk partitions. This is useful
 for creating space for new operating systems, reorganising
 disk usage, and copying data to new hard disks. This package
 contains the Parted binary and manual page.
 .
 This package contains the i18n message catalogs for
 libparted and parted.
 .
 Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD, GPT, MIPS and
 PC98 disklabels/partition tables, as well as a 'loop' (raw
 disk) type which allows use on RAID/LVM. Filesystems which
 are currently fully supported are ext2, ext3, fat (FAT16
 and FAT32), ReiserFS (with libreiserfs) and linux-swap.
 Parted can also detect and remove HFS (Mac OS), JFS, NTFS,
 UFS (Sun and HP), XFS and ASFS/AFFS/APFS (Amiga) filesystems,
 but cannot create, resize or check these filesystems yet.
 .
 Note that ReiserFS support is only enabled if you install
 the libreiserfs0.3-0 package. Since libreiserfs0.3-0 has been
 removed from sarge, ReiserFS support is not compiled in the
 default package.
 .
 The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause
 massive data loss. While there are no known bugs at the moment,
 they could exist, so please back up all important files before
 running it, and do so at your own risk.

Description: CGI::Fast Perl module
 CGI::Fast is a subclass of the CGI object created by CGI.pm.  It is
 specialized to work well with the Open Market FastCGI standard, which
 greatly speeds up CGI scripts by turning them into persistently running
 server processes.  Scripts that perform time-consuming initialization
 processes, such as loading large modules or opening persistent database
 connections, will see large performance improvements.

Description: server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language (apache 2 filter module)
 This package provides the PHP5 Filter module for the Apache 2 webserver (as
 found in the apache2-mpm-prefork package).  Please note that this package
 ONLY works with Apache's prefork MPM, as it is not compiled thread-safe.
 .
 Unless you specifically need filter-module support, you most likely
 should instead install libapache2-mod-php5.
 .
 The following extensions are built in: bcmath bz2 calendar ctype date dba
 dom exif filter ftp gettext hash iconv json libxml mbstring mime_magic
 openssl pcre posix Reflection session shmop SimpleXML soap sockets SPL
 standard sysvmsg sysvsem sysvshm tokenizer wddx xml xmlreader xmlwriter zip
 zlib.
 .
 PHP5 is an HTML-embedded scripting language. Much of its syntax is borrowed
 from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific features thrown
 in. The goal of the language is to allow web developers to write dynamically
 generated pages quickly. This version of PHP5 was built with the Suhosin patch.

Description: PulseAudio sound server
 PulseAudio, previously known as Polypaudio, is a sound server for POSIX and
 WIN32 systems. It is a drop in replacement for the ESD sound server with
 much better latency, mixing/re-sampling quality and overall architecture.
 .
 These are some of PulseAudio's features:
 .
   * High quality software mixing of multiple audio streams with support for
     more than one sink/source. May be used to combine multiple sound cards
     into one (with sample rate adjustment).
 .
   * Wide range of supported client libraries. ESD, ALSA, oss, libao and
     GStreamer client applications are supported as-is. Native PulseAudio
     plug-ins are also available for xmms and mplayer.
 .
   * Good low latency behaviour and very accurate latency measurement for
     playback and recording. Ability to fully synchronize multiple playback
     streams.
 .
   * Network transparency, allowing an application to play back or record
     audio on a different machine than the one it is running on.
 .
   * Extensible plug-in architecture with plug-ins for jackd, multicast-rtp
     lirc and avahi, just to name a few.
 .
 This package contains the daemon and basic module set.

 (strings, lists, arrays), powerful wxDateTime class for date manipulations,
 portable wrappers around many OS-specific functions allowing to build the
 same program under all supported folders, wxThread class for writing
 multithreaded programs using either Win32 or POSIX threads and much more.
 wxBase currently supports the following platforms: Generic Unix (Linux,
 FreeBSD, Solaris, HP-UX, ...) win32, and BeOS.
 .
 This package provides a debug version of the wxBase library.  It is compiled
 both with -g for normal debugger tracing and with the __WXDEBUG__ flag which
 provides many internal checks by wxWidgets itself that are not performed on
 apps compiled with the 'release version' libs in the -dev package.

 headers and a pkg-config file for drivers using autotools to build
 against.

Description: distributed multihead X server
 Xdmx is a proxy X server that uses one or more other X servers as its
 display device(s). It provides multi-head X functionality for displays that
 might be located on different machines. Xdmx functions as a front-end X server
 that acts as a proxy to a set of back-end X servers. All of the visible
 rendering is passed to the back-end X servers. Clients connect to the Xdmx
 front-end, and everything appears as it would in a regular multi-head
 configuration. If Xinerama is enabled (e.g., with +xinerama on the command
 line), the clients see a single large screen.

Description: Nested X server
 Xnest is a nested X server that simply relays all its requests to another
 X server, where it runs as a client.  This means that it appears as another
 window in your current X session.  Xnest relies upon its parent X server
 for font services.
 .
 Use of the Xephyr X server instead of Xnest is recommended.

Description: Virtual Framebuffer 'fake' X server
 Xvfb provides an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
 and no physical input devices. It emulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual
 memory. The primary use of this server was intended to be server testing,
 but other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients
 against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with
 Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the
 X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run
 applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one
 anyway.
 .
 This package also contains a convenience script called xvfb-run which
 simplifies the automated execution of X clients in a virtual server
 environment. This convenience script requires the use of the xauth
 program.

Description: nested X server
 Xephyr is an X server that can be run inside another X server,
 much like Xnest. It is based on the kdrive X server, and as a
 result it supports newer extensions than Xnest, including render and
 composite.
