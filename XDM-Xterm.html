This document describes the basic ideas for using XDM to manage X
terminals. It is not meant to be a comprehensive discussion of all
the features of XDM, but a gentle introduction to what XDM can do.
</p>
<p>
For a full discussion about the installation and configuration of X
terminals, please refer to the 'Thin-client' HOWTO, from the Linux
Documentation Project or the Linux Terminal Server Project (see
<a href="#RESOURCES">Section 7</a>).

</h3>
<p>
<a name="COVERAGE" id="COVERAGE">This document describes the basic
concepts behind using XDM (the X Display Manager) to manage X
terminals and X servers, in order to provide 'thin-client'
computing, using Linux.</a>
</p><a name="COVERAGE" id="COVERAGE"></a>
<p>
X (or the 'X Window System') is the windowing and graphics
environment of choice for Unix systems. Its particular strength
(and the key bit that we are interested in for this document) is
that it separates the running applications (web browser, word
processor, etc) from the actual graphics screen and input devices
(mouse, keyboard, etc) via a network communications mechanism.
</p>
<p>
Essentially, this means that you can be running an application on
one machine, but have its input and output redirected to another
machine via a network. This is the key feature that makes an X
terminal possible.
</p>
<p>
This document should be treated as a 'getting started with XDM'
document, in that it describes the basic terms and concepts for
using XDM and X terminals, with simple examples that provide the
minimum amount of security.
</p>
<p>
The reader is advised to consult the list of resources provided at
the end of the document in order to proceed beyond these basic
facilities - in particular, the configuration of the
'authentication' and security settings should be examined, as the
examples given in this document utilise the least secure modes of
operation.
</p>
<p>
Please note - the majority of the information in this document was
obtained from systems running Debian 2.1, SuSE 6.4, Mandrake 7.0
and RedHat 6.0.
</p>
<p>
This document does not discuss the installation or configuration of
a network or X on Linux. Please refer to the appropriate HOWTO
documents from the Linux Documentation Project for details (see
<a href="#RESOURCES">Section 7</a>).
</p>
<p>
This document also does not attempt to describe how to install and
configure Linux for operation as an X terminal. For this
information, please refer to the 'thin-client' HOWTO document,
provided as part of the Linux Documentation Project, or the Linux
Terminal Server Project (see <a href="#RESOURCES">Section 7</a>).

<p>
<a name="ABOUT" id="ABOUT">This document came about because I
wanted to experiment with Linux on a 486 PC as an X terminal to my
main Linux box.</a>
</p><a name="ABOUT" id="ABOUT"></a>
<p>
After reading the man pages, specifications and current howto
documents relating to XDM and X terminals, I ended up getting
really confused about where XDM was supposed to run and confusing
XDM servers with X servers and the like, and so after an evening or
two of experimentation, this document was born.
</p>
<p>
Once the basic terminology has been sorted out, the documentation
for XDM and self-documenting sample files make very good reading -
I just could not find a simple introduction to the basic concepts
anywhere to get me started. Hopefully this document could prove to
be a suitable introduction to someone in a similar position to me.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and in case you are wondering, a 486dx2/66 with 16 Mb RAM makes
a fine X terminal!

<a name="XDM-WHAT" id="XDM-WHAT">3.1. What is XDM</a>
</h3>
<p>
<a name="XDM-WHAT" id="XDM-WHAT">Put simply, XDM (the X Display
Manager) can be thought of as a graphical replacement for the
command line 'login' prompt. In reality, it can actually do much
more than that.</a>
</p><a name="XDM-WHAT" id="XDM-WHAT"></a>
<p>
Typically, it would be started by the 'root' user (or the system
startup scripts) on power up, and would present a user with a
graphical login prompt. It will then manage the users X session
once they login - i.e. it will initiate the running of their window
manager and applications.
</p>
<p>
This could be considered a typical 'simple local machine login'
configuration, as may be found installed by many Linux
distributions by default. However, XDM can also manage remote X
servers and provide login prompts to remote 'X terminals'. In
short, it is not limited to the local machine - it can easily
manage other machines connected via a network.
</p>
<p>
XDM is a very configurable utility and this document will only just
'scratch the surface' of what may be achieved. This document aims
to provide enough information to configure your X terminals and
application servers to connect to each other. The reader is
referred to <a href="#RESOURCES">Section 7</a> for further
information on the topics discussed here.
</p>
<p>
A note on security: X (in its default configuration) and XDMCP are
not particularly secure. I am assuming that you are running X on a
'trusted' network and that security is not an issue. For details of
how to tighten up your X connections (and more details about using
the networking capabilities of X) please refer to the 'Running
Remote X Applications' Howto document, which is also part of the
LDP (see <a href="#RESOURCES">Section 7</a>).

There are several configurations of 'X terminal' with varying
levels of functionality, ranging from completely diskless terminals
to full X workstations.

<a name="XDM-TERMS" id="XDM-TERMS">3.3. Some Terminology</a>
</h3>
<p>
<a name="XDM-TERMS" id="XDM-TERMS">Before I go any further, I ought
to explain the terms I will be using in this document. When talking
about X, there is quite a lot of confusion over what is serving
facilities to what. This is especially true when you are
considering distributed sessions over a network involving X
terminals. I will be using the terms described below.</a>
</p><a name="XDM-TERMS" id="XDM-TERMS"></a>
<div class="VARIABLELIST">
<dl>
<dt>
Diskless X terminal
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This would be a machine with no local disks, that would perform its
boot up from an EPROM (or similar) and utilises a network
connection to a server. It would obtain its network configuration,
operating system, system configuration and all applications from
the server. Once booted however, this would be the same as a 'dumb
X terminal' (see below). Typically this configuration would use a
combination of the following network protocols in order to boot:
BOOTP, DHCP, TFTP, etc. Refer to <a href="#RESOURCES">Section 7</a>
for some references that detail how to build diskless X terminals.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
Dumb X terminal
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This would be a machine that boots from its local disk into an
operating system, and starts the 'X server' program and nothing
more. Somehow, a login prompt would be provided on the machine, to
enable a user to login to an 'application server' somewhere on the
network.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
X Workstation
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This would be similar to a dumb X terminal, but would provide the
option of logging on to the local machine itself, hence would be
quite capable of becoming a standalone workstation (i.e. no network
connectivity) if required. Most distributions can be configured
'out of the box' as a stand-alone X Workstation, with a graphical
login prompt.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
Application Server
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
In the context of this document, I use the term 'application
server' to describe a machine that will provide the applications (X
clients) that our X terminal will want to run. This can include
everything from editors and browsers, through to the actual 'Window
Manager' itself.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
X Server
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This is the program that manages the display of a machine with a
physical console (display, keyboard, mouse, etc). It can be thought
of as a combined graphics card, keyboard and mouse 'driver'. This
will provide these facilities as a service to X clients (hence the
term 'server'). Please refer to the X User Howto in <a href="#RESOURCES">Section 7</a> for more details.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
X Client
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This is an application that requires the use of an X server to
access input (keyboard and mouse) and output (display). An X client
cannot produce output without the services of the X server. The X
server could be running locally (on the same machine, as is the
case with an X workstation) or elsewhere on the network (as is the
case with an X terminal connecting to an Application Server).
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>
From the above descriptions, an X Workstation could be thought of
as consisting of a dumb X terminal and application server running
on the same machine.
</p>
<p>
This document will be looking at the architecture of the various
options listed above and will describe the role that XDM can play
in configuring them.

</h3>
<p>
<a name="XDM-DO" id="XDM-DO">XDM is responsible for providing the
user with a login prompt and initiating their X session. It can
manage local sessions (i.e. people logging into an X workstation)
or sessions on remote machines, via a connection to an application
server, from a diskless or dumb X terminal.</a>
</p><a name="XDM-DO" id="XDM-DO"></a>
<p>
XDM would typically run on an application server, to permit users
to logon and run applications from that server.
</p>
<p>
There are 2 main ways that XDM can interact with an X Server:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
XDM accepts queries from X server
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
XDM manages X server
</p>
</li>
</ul>

from X Server</a>
</h4>
<p>
<a name="XSERV-QUERY" id="XSERV-QUERY">The communications between
XDM and the actual 'X server' (the machines with the physical
screen/keyboard/mouse/etc) are handled via XDMCP the 'X Display
Manager Control Protocol'.</a>
</p><a name="XSERV-QUERY" id="XSERV-QUERY"></a>
<p>
This permits X servers to send out queries to servers running XDM.
Effectively, the X server has to say 'I have someone wanting to
login - please give me a login prompt'. In this mode of operation,
XDM will not do anything unless it is asked to by your X server.
</p>
<p>
The query from the X server can take one of 3 forms:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Direct query: the X server contacts a named host, requesting that
XDM on that host presents a login prompt on its display.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Broadcast: the X server sends out a broadcast message to the
network, and the first server running XDM that responds to the
broadcast will be the one to present the login prompt on its
display.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Indirect query: the X server contacts a named host, but asks it
which other hosts it knows about on the network. The named host
will then present the user with a list of hosts to choose from, and
will then go on to initiate communications with the selected host
resulting in the selected host presenting a login prompt on the X
servers display.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are several other options, but these will not be described
here - refer to the XDM and XDMCP documentation in <a href="#RESOURCES">Section 7</a> for more details.

<p>
<a name="XDM-SERVER" id="XDM-SERVER">If you have a set of machines
(e.g. diskless or dumb X terminals) that just end up running an X
server, all designed to provide a login prompt to a single
application server, then it is possible to configure XDM on the
application server to connect back to each X server and present its
login prompt on each display automatically.</a>
</p><a name="XDM-SERVER" id="XDM-SERVER"></a>
<p>
In this mode of operation, XDM will actively 'push out' a login
prompt to any listed X server that it knows about, without waiting
for a query from the X servers themselves.
</p>
<p>
In this case, the configuration file 'Xservers' (see later) lists
each machine (including the local display, if required) to which
XDM should connect, to display its login prompt.
</p>
<p>
This configuration, when used with no remote X servers listed in
the configuration, is the typical configuration used for a X
workstation, in order to present a user with a graphical login to
the local machine he is working on. As stated earlier, most
distributions will support this configuration 'out of the box' in
order to present the user with a local graphical login prompt.
</p>
<p>
Note: XDM must be permitted to connect to the X servers in question
- so the access control on the X servers must be configured
accordingly.

each of these cases, by using the following 2 lines in xdm-config:
</p>
<table bgcolor="#e0e0e0" border="1" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<pre class="SCREEN"><font color="#000000">      DisplayManager._0.resources            /etc/X11/xdm/Xres_0
      DisplayManager*resources               /etc/X11/xdm/Xresources
      </font>
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>This will use Xres_0 for the local display (_0 is the XDM
way of saying :0) and Xresources for everything else (the '*').
<p>
Similarly, if you wanted a particular resource file for a specific
host, you would use an entry like the following:
</p>
<table bgcolor="#e0e0e0" border="1" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<pre class="SCREEN"><font color="#000000">      DisplayManager.host_0.resources       /etc/X11/xdm/Xres_host_0
      </font>
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
Note that XDM configuration files use the terminology host_0, where
you would normally use host:0, to designate 'display 0 on host'.
</p>
<p>
If you look over your default xdm-config file, you will probably
find that it has been setup so that your local X server has
different files to the remote ones anyway, as different things must
be performed on startup and reset of the server. My Debian file has
the following for local servers:
</p>
<table bgcolor="#e0e0e0" border="1" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<pre class="SCREEN"><font color="#000000">      DisplayManager._0.resources:    /etc/X11/xdm/Xresources_0
      DisplayManager._0.setup:        /etc/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0
      DisplayManager._0.startup:      /etc/X11/xdm/Xstartup_0
      DisplayManager._0.reset:        /etc/X11/xdm/Xreset_0
      </font>
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>and the following for remote servers:
<table bgcolor="#e0e0e0" border="1" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<pre class="SCREEN"><font color="#000000">      DisplayManager*resources:       /etc/X11/xdm/Xresources

I have not got this to work yet, as I don't have a Solaris box that
I have any control over - but I am told that a font entry in

<a name="CFGS-LINWIN" id="CFGS-LINWIN">It is not possible to use X
to remotely display Windows applications on a Windows box. It is
possible to use X to display Windows versions of X applications on
a Linux box, using a Windows X Server and Windows X applications
(for example the XFree86 Win32 port - see</a> <a href="#RESOURCES">Section 7</a>)
</p>
<p>
It is possible to view Windows applications remotely on a Linux box
using one of the following applications (which don't rely on X or
XDM):
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Windows Terminal Services (WTS). RDesktop is a Linux application
that understands the 'RDP' protocol used by WTS. This enables Linux
to act as a client to WTS (see <a href="#RESOURCES">Section 7</a>).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Vitual Network Computing (VNC). This is an excellent platform
independent remote desktop system that provides a bi-directional
'Windows or Linux' to 'Windows or Linux' networked desktop. It can
be a bit slow, but works well (see <a href="#RESOURCES">Section
7</a>).
</p>
<p>
You can actually do quite strange things with VNC, such has having
multiple machines connect and 'control' the desktop (and
consequently 'fight' over control of the mouse :). It also doesn't
maintain any state in the client, so you can leave your client,
shutdown, bootup again, reconnect and carry on from where you left
off. There is even a version of the viewer implemented as a Java
applet, usable from any Java-enabled web browser.

There are many commercial X Server implementations for Windows, and
I will not list them all here. There is also a port of XFree86 to
Windows, that makes use of the cygwin libraries (used to port many
GNU/Linux tools to Windows - see <a href="#RESOURCES">Section
7</a>). This works well.
</p>
<p>
The following batch file would start the cygwin XFree86 X server on
Windows and connect to a Linux box (or any OS/machine running XDM),
assuming a default installation of cygwin and XFree86 in c:\cygwin
(save it as xdm.bat):
